| Criteria                                                         | Does Not Meet Specifications                                                                                                                                                          | Meets Specifications                                                                                                                                                              |

| Question 1: Plotting a histogram of card values                  | The histogram does not accurately reflect the card values’ relative frequency distribution or no histogram is provided.                                                               | A histogram is provided that accurately reflects the card values’ relative frequency distribution.                                                                                |
| Question 2: Obtain samples from a deck of cards                  | Sampled data is not provided, insufficient, or does not reflect the experiment being performed for the project.                                                                       | At least thirty samples have been performed and the summed values from each sample have been reported in a submitted spreadsheet.                                                 |
| Question 3: Report descriptive statistics regarding sample taken | Two measures of central tendency and variability are not reported to describe the sample or are not computed correctly.                                                               | At least two measures of central tendency and two measures of variability are accurately reported to summarize and describe the samples taken for Question 2.                     |
| Question 4: Plotting a histogram of sampled values               | The histogram does not accurately reflect sampled values or no histogram is provided. No discussion of the shape of the distribution is provided or comparison is not well-justified. | A histogram accurately reflecting the sampled data is provided. Discussion of the shape is provided, including a comparison to that of the histogram of the original card values. |
| Question 5: Making estimates based on the sampled distribution   | Estimates made for the prompted questions do not reflect the values obtained from the sample.                                                                                         | Estimates are made for the prompted questions that reflect the samples taken and their distribution.                                                                              |
